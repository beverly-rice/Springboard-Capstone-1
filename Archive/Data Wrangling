Springboard Capstone 1 Project: Data Wrangling
19 Dec 2017

Assignment:  Create a short document (1-2 pages) in your github 
describing the data wrangling steps that you undertook to clean 
your capstone project data set. What kind of cleaning steps did 
you perform? How did you deal with missing values, if any? Were 
there outliers, and how did you decide to handle them? This 
document will eventually become part of your milestone report.

See Data Wrangling.ipynb for more...

Step 1: Acquire Data
The data was acquired through the kaggle.com KKBox Challenge page: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge/data.  
Each file was downloaded and saved to a folder in my home directory

Step 2: Conduct Initial Explortory Data Analysis
  - Applied .info() to each file to view entries, columns and types.  
    Also used .info() and isnull () to determine if there were any 
    null values
  - Applied .describe() to each file to get count/mean/std/min/max 
    25/50/75 for each column
  - Applied .columns to get just the names of each column
  - Applied .duplicated() to each file to determine if there were 
    any duplicate entries
  - Applied .head() to get initial visual of data
  - Applied .size and .unique() to ID unique values for each column
  - Applied .loc() to slice data

Step 3: Conduct Visual Exploratory Analysis
  - Plotted frequency counts for categorical data
  - Applied pd.to_datetime() to convert dates to the appropriate format
  - Plotted frequency counts for time variables
  - Bucketed data for clearer visuals
  - Dropped duplicate 'subscriptions/activity' from same member
  - Plotted single subscription/activity for each member with respect 
    to each variable 
  - Identified outliers
  - Visualized multiple variables

Step 4: Create New Variables
  - Applied groupby(), sum(), and count() 
  - Narrowed down dates to month, weekday, and day of month
  - Logically deduced info from existing variables
  - Plotted frequency counts for new variables

Step 5: Combine Files for Further Analysis
  - Applied concat(), merge(), and to_csv() 
  - Removed dirty/erroneous data
  - Dropped duplicate data
  - Created additional variables

List of Changes Made
1.  Removed ‘bd’ variable – ranged from -7000 to +2000 and over 67% 
    reported an age of ‘0’
2.  Removed ‘gender’ variable – 65% did not report a gender; analysis 
    shows that reported males and females churned at a very similar 
    rate, 17.6% and 16.9% respectively.  
3.  Removed members who registered before 2010 – KKBox went international 
    in 2009 and also received investments from at least 2 big-name companies; 
    there was a significant increase in membership starting in 2010
4.  Added Variable - registration day and month
5.  Added Boolean – whether member used multiple payment methods
6.  Added Boolean – whether member used multiple payment plans
7.  Added Boolean – whether member received a discount
8.  Added Variable – total subscriptions per member
9.  Added Variable – total membership time
10. Added Variable – total days used
11. Added Variable – total songs listened to throughout membership
12. Added Variable – total songs listened to more than once
13. Added Variables – percentage of songs listened to for only 25%, 50%, 75%, 
    98.5% and 100% of the song length throughout membership
14. Created master file containing a single entry for each member with 
    variables for further analysis
