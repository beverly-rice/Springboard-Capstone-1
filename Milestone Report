Project: WSDM – KKBox’s Churn Prediction Challenge
Source: Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge

Background: KKBox is Asia’s leading music streaming service, holding the 
world’s most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million 
tracks.  They have expanded to support Windows, Mac OS X, IOS, Android, 
Symbian, Bada, and Java phones.  Subscribers have praised the service’s 
relevance of search results, advanced search function, and content search 
function over similar providers.  To support operations, the company offers 
freemium and “pay-per-month” subscriptions.    

Problem: Build an algorithm that accurately predicts whether a paid KKBox 
user will not renew or purchase a new subscription within 30 days post 
membership expiration.

Client: KKBox dominated the market in 2008 with 80% market share and in 
2015 announced that they acquired over 10 million cumulative users in 
the past decade.  They’ve boasted over 1600 registered artists and celebrities 
and currently compete with Apple iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube. They hope to 
identify factors that contribute to why users leave so they can be proactive 
in maintaining their customers. 

Data: KKBox provided 5 files in the challenge: 
  1. train_v2: the train set containing user IDs and whether they have churned
  
  2. members_v3: select user information to include member ID, city, age, 
  gender, registration method, and registration initialization time
  
  3. transactions_v2: transactions of users until March 31, 2017 - includes
  user ID, payment method, payment plan, plan price, amount paid, whether
  the member opted to auto-renew or auto-cancel their subscription, 
  transaction date, and membership expiration date
  
  4. user_logs_v2: daily user logs describing listening behaviors of select 
  users - includes user ID, date of log, the number of songs played less 
  than 25% of the song length, between 25-50% of the song length, between 50-75%
  of the song length, between 75-98.5% of the song length, and over 98.5% of the
  song length.  It also includes the number of unique songs and the total seconds 
  played for the given log entry
  
  5. sample_submission_v2: the test set, containing the user IDs in the format 
  KKBox expects it to be submitted in - it incnludes the user ID and churn prediction
